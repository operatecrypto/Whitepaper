3. A ecetralized process engine
4. A ecetralized database engine and storage
5. Trusted connectivery to centralized world
6. A trust execution environment for Nodes
7. A trusted remote processing
8. An app development studio
9. A rules development studio
10. A website development studio
11. A process development studio
12. A smart contract development studio

In three phases, OperateCrypto aims to deliver a platform that will be capable of hostng enterprise scale applications on decentralized world
