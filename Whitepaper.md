# Whitepaper

## Introduction
Complex database applications, such as eCommerce applications, were once deemed impossible in the decentralized world. However, this perception is about to change.

OperateCrypto is currently in the process of building sophisticated data applications in the decentralized realm. In the initial stages of the project, we plan to leverage various existing blockchain projects, including Ethereum, Polygon, and FileCoin. Nevertheless, to establish a truly sustainable decentralized platform, the following key components are essential:

1. A next-generation wallet (with a wallet-server connection)
2. A decentralized rules engine
3. A decentralized process engine
4. A decentralized database engine and storage
5. Trusted connectivity to the centralized world
6. A trusted execution environment for nodes
7. Trusted remote processing
8. An app development studio
9. A rules development studio
10. A website development studio
11. A process development studio
12. A smart contract development studio

Operate Crypto aims to deliver a platform capable of hosting enterprise-scale applications in the decentralized world in three phases.
 

## Intruging but difficult to believe?
We already have made great progress. Check out the youtube demos. We are uploading demo videos. 
Also attend AMA sessions to find out how much we have established.
Proof of concepts such as RuleEngine on consesnus will be made available only when it is time. So much demostrable work is already established


## High level components

1. DDApps - Decentralized Data Apps
Imagine a hospitable management software or eCommerce application completely built on decentralized technology
2. Web2
   An application will be restricted if it cannot interact with Web2. Until all applications in the world is mingrated into Web 2, applications will eventually need to reach out to Web 2 world for data and information. Also during the development phase 1, many features of the app will depend on Web2 technologies such as Email

3. Web3
The system will have high trust established with the custom wallet. That is why we call it Web3+

4. DE-PIN
The current decentralized physical infrastruture is fast maturing. If we find an efficient and trust worthy partner on individual integration points such as email or SMS, we will utilize them

5. Blockchain
Blockchain will be engaged for several usecases differently. Several scenarios are discussed here


## Architectural Blueprint
Given below the high level architecture of operate crypto.

## Layered Architecture
A detail level architecture is provided below
![image](https://github.com/operatecrypto/Whitepaper/assets/91952872/67dbf761-9e09-4e1b-952f-5608051ea96c)

Each of the layers are explained in the section below. Watch our Architecture shows on youtube to get more understanding of each layer. 

1. Architecture shows - primarly discusses architecture and
2. Demo shows - demos from working applications
3. App shows - explains everything about a particular app.
  
Remember, more than 312 apps are under the scope the project. But dont worry, many of them already made great progress - watch the demo or AMA series

## Layer 1- BASE LAYER
This layer reresents mostly blockchains and IPFS

![image](https://github.com/operatecrypto/Whitepaper/assets/91952872/4e813635-00e3-47df-a45a-06b92c6ec7b1)

This layer will be developed by ecosystem developers(not app developers).
## Layer 2. BASE ACCESS LAYER

This layer will be developed by Operate crypto to interact with blockchain, ipfs, DePIN providers and centralized systems such as Amazon S3

Given below the blockchain access layer

This layer will be developed by ecosystem developers(not app developers).
## Layer 3. BLOCKCHAIN ORCHESTRATION LAYER
Even though the base access layer deals with various systems, they need to be synchronized and transactional consistenacy will have to be ensured. The orchastration layer will manage this. 

This layer will be developed by ecosystem developers(not app developers).

## Approach

### Agile
We like agile development and incremental delivery
   - Incremental
   - Always delivered
   - Don’t reinvent the wheel
### Strategic partnership
We are interested only in strategic partnership. That means if partnered, long term vesting options will be established
   - No compromise on vision and road map
### Deliver top layer first
   Our initial approach was to deliver the core base components. But later we realized, it is wise to deliver top controls with basic core components. That wasy we can 
   - Make revenue early (reinvest revenue)
   - Flexibility on architecture (We can choose some of the partners as last step)
   - User adoption passed early
   - That means the base components will only offer the minimum vialble features

## Side chains & Private chains
Private nodes can run completely seperated private installations with "Proof of Authority" model.

## Initial support
Phase 2- ERC20
Phase 3- BRC20


## Partners and investors
Team is really busy developing applications. Our focus is not shifted into funding. Not worrying about the market and investors gives all of us a lot of focus. Remember, focus is key, esepcially when we have to deliver 300+ apps in such as short span of time. So we are not reaching out to VCs yet. But if you really want to make a significant investment in the project, write to operatecrypto@gmail.com

## Promoters
No, we are not promoting the project yet. However you are more than wecome to invite us for interviews. Currently we are engaing only in tech discussions.

## General public
Please join our groups and get engaged in activities. We need lot of help on development, testing and developing ecosystem apps.

## Token
Token: Operate (OperateCrypto) on Polygon network. We are not going to release it yet. So dont fall for scammers
