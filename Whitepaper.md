# Introduction
Complex database applications, such as eCommerce applications, were once deemed impossible in the decentralized world. However, this perception is about to change.

OperateCrypto is currently in the process of building sophisticated data applications in the decentralized realm. In the initial stages of the project, we plan to leverage various existing blockchain projects, including Ethereum, Polygon, and FileCoin. Nevertheless, to establish a truly sustainable decentralized platform, the following key components are essential:

1. A next-generation wallet (with a wallet-server connection)
2. A decentralized rules engine
3. A decentralized process engine
4. A decentralized database engine and storage
5. Trusted connectivity to the centralized world
6. A trusted execution environment for nodes
7. Trusted remote processing
8. An app development studio
9. A rules development studio
10. A website development studio
11. A process development studio
12. A smart contract development studio

Operate Crypto aims to deliver a platform capable of hosting enterprise-scale applications in the decentralized world in three phases.
 

# Intriguing but difficult to believe?

We have made significant progress already. Explore our YouTube demos, where we are regularly uploading demonstration videos. Additionally, attend our Ask Me Anything (AMA) sessions to gain insights into the substantial groundwork we've accomplished. Proof of concepts, such as the RuleEngine on consensus, will be shared when the time is right. There is already a considerable amount of demonstrable work that has been established.

## High level components

1. DDApps - Decentralized Data Apps

Imagine hospitable management software or an eCommerce application completely built on decentralized technology.

2. Web2

An application will be restricted if it cannot interact with Web2. Until all applications in the world are migrated into Web 2, applications will eventually need to reach out to the Web2 world for data and information. Also, during the development phase 1, many features of the app will depend on Web2 technologies, such as Email.

3. Web3

The system will establish high trust with the custom wallet. That's why we call it Web3+.

4. DE-PIN

The current decentralized physical infrastructure is fast maturing. If we find an efficient and trustworthy partner on individual integration points, such as email or SMS, we will utilize them.

5. Blockchain

Blockchain will be engaged for several use cases differently. Various scenarios are discussed here.

# Approach

### Agile
We embrace agile development and incremental delivery.
   - Incremental progress
   - Consistent delivery
   - Avoid reinventing the wheel

### Strategic Partnership
We prioritize strategic partnerships. This implies that, with a partnership established, long-term vesting options will be put in place.
   - No compromise on vision and roadmap

### Deliver Top Layer First
Our initial strategy was to deliver the core base components. However, we later realized it is wise to deliver top controls along with basic core components. This way, we can:
   - Generate revenue early (reinvest revenue)
   - Retain flexibility in architecture (Partner selection can be a later step)
   - Achieve early user adoption
   - Ensure that base components offer only the minimum viable features

# Side Chains & Private Chains
Private nodes can operate as completely separate installations using the "Proof of Authority" model.


# Initial Support
Phase 2 - ERC20
Phase 3 - BRC20

# Partners and Investors
Our team is currently focused on developing applications, and our attention has not shifted to fundraising. Not actively seeking market engagement and investors allows us to maintain a concentrated focus.
