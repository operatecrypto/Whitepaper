# Whitepaper

## Introduction
Complex database applications such as eCommerce applications were never a possibility in the decentralized world.

Well, it is going to change soon.

Operate crypto is in the process of buidling complex data applications in the decentralized world. 

In the beginning of the project, we will utilize several existing Blockchain projects like Ethereum, Polygon and FileCoin. However, to build a true sustainable decentralized platform, these are the key components that are required
1. A next generation wallet (with a wallet-server connection)
2. A ecetralized rules engine
3. A ecetralized process engine
4. A ecetralized database engine and storage
5. Trusted connectivery to centralized world
6. A trust execution environment for Nodes
7. A trusted remote processing
8. An app development studio
9. A rules development studio
10. A website development studio
11. A process development studio
12. A smart contract development studio

In three phases, OperateCrypto aims to deliver a platform that will be capable of hostng enterprise scale applications on decentralized world 

## Intruging but difficult to believe?
We already have made great progress. Check out the youtube demos. We are uploading demo videos. 
Also attend AMA sessions to find out how much we have established.
Proof of concepts such as RuleEngine on consesnus will be made available only when it is time. So much demostrable work is already established


## High level components

1. DDApps - Decentralized Data Apps
Imagine a hospitable management software or eCommerce application completely built on decentralized technology
2. Web2
   An application will be restricted if it cannot interact with Web2. Until all applications in the world is mingrated into Web 2, applications will eventually need to reach out to Web 2 world for data and information. Also during the development phase 1, many features of the app will depend on Web2 technologies such as Email

3. Web3
The system will have high trust established with the custom wallet. That is why we call it Web3+

4. DE-PIN
The current decentralized physical infrastruture is fast maturing. If we find an efficient and trust worthy partner on individual integration points such as email or SMS, we will utilize them

5. Blockchain
Blockchain will be engaged for several usecases differently. Several scenarios are discussed here
