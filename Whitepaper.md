# Whitepaper

# Introduction
Complex database applications, such as eCommerce applications, were once deemed impossible in the decentralized world. However, this perception is about to change.

OperateCrypto is currently in the process of building sophisticated data applications in the decentralized realm. In the initial stages of the project, we plan to leverage various existing blockchain projects, including Ethereum, Polygon, and FileCoin. Nevertheless, to establish a truly sustainable decentralized platform, the following key components are essential:

1. A next-generation wallet (with a wallet-server connection)
2. A decentralized rules engine
3. A decentralized process engine
4. A decentralized database engine and storage
5. Trusted connectivity to the centralized world
6. A trusted execution environment for nodes
7. Trusted remote processing
8. An app development studio
9. A rules development studio
10. A website development studio
11. A process development studio
12. A smart contract development studio

Operate Crypto aims to deliver a platform capable of hosting enterprise-scale applications in the decentralized world in three phases.
 

# Intriguing but difficult to believe?

We have made significant progress already. Explore our YouTube demos, where we are regularly uploading demonstration videos. Additionally, attend our Ask Me Anything (AMA) sessions to gain insights into the substantial groundwork we've accomplished. Proof of concepts, such as the RuleEngine on consensus, will be shared when the time is right. There is already a considerable amount of demonstrable work that has been established.

## High level components

1. DDApps - Decentralized Data Apps

Imagine hospitable management software or an eCommerce application completely built on decentralized technology.

2. Web2

An application will be restricted if it cannot interact with Web2. Until all applications in the world are migrated into Web 2, applications will eventually need to reach out to the Web2 world for data and information. Also, during the development phase 1, many features of the app will depend on Web2 technologies, such as Email.

3. Web3

The system will establish high trust with the custom wallet. That's why we call it Web3+.

4. DE-PIN

The current decentralized physical infrastructure is fast maturing. If we find an efficient and trustworthy partner on individual integration points, such as email or SMS, we will utilize them.

5. Blockchain

Blockchain will be engaged for several use cases differently. Various scenarios are discussed here.

## Layer 1 - BASE LAYER
This layer represents primarily blockchains and IPFS.

![image](https://github.com/operatecrypto/Whitepaper/assets/91952872/4e813635-00e3-47df-a45a-06b92c6ec7b1)

This layer will be developed by ecosystem developers, not app developers.

## Layer 2. BASE ACCESS LAYER

This layer will be developed by OperateCrypto to interact with blockchain, IPFS, DePIN providers, and centralized systems such as Amazon S3.

Below is the Blockchain Access Layer:

# Approach

### Agile
We like agile development and incremental delivery
   - Incremental
   - Always delivered
   - Don’t reinvent the wheel
### Strategic partnership
We are interested only in strategic partnership. That means if partnered, long term vesting options will be established
   - No compromise on vision and road map
### Deliver top layer first
   Our initial approach was to deliver the core base components. But later we realized, it is wise to deliver top controls with basic core components. That wasy we can 
   - Make revenue early (reinvest revenue)
   - Flexibility on architecture (We can choose some of the partners as last step)
   - User adoption passed early
   - That means the base components will only offer the minimum vialble features

# Side chains & Private chains
Private nodes can run completely seperated private installations with "Proof of Authority" model.

# Initial support
Phase 2- ERC20
Phase 3- BRC20


# Partners and investors
Team is really busy developing applications. Our focus is not shifted into funding. Not worrying about the market and investors gives all of us a lot of focus. Remember, focus is key, esepcially when we have to deliver 300+ apps in such as short span of time. So we are not reaching out to VCs yet. But if you really want to make a significant investment in the project, write to operatecrypto@gmail.com

# Promoters
No, we are not promoting the project yet. However you are more than wecome to invite us for interviews. Currently we are engaing only in tech discussions.

# General public
Please join our groups and get engaged in activities. We need lot of help on development, testing and developing ecosystem apps.

# Token
Token: Operate (OperateCrypto) on Polygon network. We are not going to release it yet. So dont fall for scammers

# How can you own tokens?
### Public Launch - Not Yet
   - (Wait for announcement from all our social media platforms - watch out for fake coin announcements)
### Airdrops 
opportunities will be announced on our social media
### Community developer 
We need all kind of help - you will be rewarded with Operate tokens
### Develop business apps on our platform 
We will train you. We support provide initial development funding for a limited time
### Donate Matic to our developer funding Matic address. 
- Matic Address: “0x91a8eBb78129dcA2e9bCF998645F3cE99B033352”.(Please compare this with all our social media apps and main web site. Mutiple point validation is key.)
- If you donate Matic to the funding address, you will receive early tokens at much cheaper prices through airdrops. Higher matic means larger airdrops.

# Warning

### Verify Truth
   - Reach out to community and ensure addresses before you purchase
   - Don’t get scammed
### All initial funds will be used for development. If development is halted due to any reason, it is a financial risk. Do your due diligence
### When you decide to use our ecosystem apps:
   - Ensure the app is certified (Unless it is critical data)
   - We are engaging with a third party testing team for certification
   - Many testnet servers don’t offer databack - ensure you have back figured out
   - Never store your private keys or sensitive passwords on the servers
         -  Our testnet servers are not secured yet. We are not even allowing you to store privatekeys yet
